# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Base Emotion and Attitude

We're aiming High. So are you. Let's be ambitious and creative. **Lingual** have a potential to contribute in reshaping education in this AI agent era and significantly impact how language is learned in classroom.
For now it's only spoken language learning, but ultimately the structure of Lingual can extend much further to other subjects, achieving powerful AI-based education empire that encompasses not only langauge learning but also math, science, history, and so on.

## Project Overview

**Lingual** is an AI-powered platform for learning colloquial/spoken language through real-time conversation practice. Our mission is to become **the standard for spoken language learning**.

### Current Priority

**School integration** is the top priority. The system has moved beyond B2C-only assumptions. All new work should follow the formal school-integration documents:

- `docs/school-integration/PRD.md` - product goals, scope, success metrics
- `docs/school-integration/TECH_SPEC.md` - architecture, domain model, API design
- `docs/school-integration/TASKS.md` - phased checklist and build order
- `docs/school-integration/LIMITATIONS.md` - known gaps and temporary shortcuts

### Document-Driven Development

All school-integration work follows a document-first workflow. The four spec documents are the authoritative source of truth — code implements what the docs describe, and docs are updated to match what code ships.

**Update order:** PRD → TECH_SPEC → TASKS → LIMITATIONS.md

| Document | Purpose | When to update |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `PRD.md` | Product goals, user stories, success metrics | Scope, user stories, or success criteria change |
| `TECH_SPEC.md` | Architecture, domain model, API design | Architecture decisions, data models, or API surface change |
| `TASKS.md` | Phased checklist (`[x]`/`[-]`/`[ ]`) | Items start, complete, or new items are identified |
| `LIMITATIONS.md` | Shipped constraints, temporary shortcuts | Shipped behavior is narrower than the intended architecture |

**Rules for Claude Code:**

- Before starting a feature: read the relevant PRD → TECH_SPEC → TASKS sections to understand scope and architecture
- After shipping: mark TASKS.md items complete, add LIMITATIONS.md entries for any behavior narrower than spec
- Do not implement features that contradict TECH_SPEC architecture without updating docs first
- When the user says "update docs," refresh all four documents to match the current codebase state
- When a feature introduces new architecture (new collections, API surface, domain concepts), update TECH_SPEC before or alongside the implementation

### Vision & Roadmap

| Aspect | Current (v1) | Future |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Languages** | Korean (SKLC-aligned), French (AP sample) | Spanish, Russian |
| **Market** | B2B-first (K-12 schools, language institutes) | Broader B2C |
| **Platform** | Web only | Web + Native mobile apps |

### User Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Student** | Assessment, assignment-aware AI practice, progress tracking |
| **Teacher** | Class management, Canvas-linked or teacher-authored assignment creation, analytics |
| **Administrator** | School-wide analytics, multi-teacher management, billing |

### Core Learning Flow

1. Teacher creates class → authors assignment from Canvas content or teacher input → publishes assignment
2. Student launches assignment-aware speaking practice (voice/text/hybrid)
3. AI tutor follows assignment context (instructions, generated scenario, target expressions, focus grammar)
4. System captures learning events → builds session summaries → rolls up analytics
5. Teacher reviews class/assignment/student analytics to inform instruction

**Key Principle:** Curriculum is the backbone - teachers design the exercise, AI executes it at student scale.

## Development Commands

## Architecture

### Backend

- **Flask** app registered via blueprints in `main.py`

- **Firestore** for all persistence (users, schools, sessions, events)
- **OpenAI GPT Realtime API** powers live conversation with ephemeral token auth
- **Firebase Auth** ID tokens verified server-side

Backend is organized into:
- `main.py` - Flask app, blueprint registration, legacy routes
- `database.py` - Firestore CRUD helpers for all collections
- `backend/routes/` - Blueprint modules (auth, chat, teacher, curriculum_admin, schools, pronunciation)
- `backend/services/` - Domain services (assignment_resolver, practice_analytics, membership_context, compliance)
- `backend/route_deps.py` - Shared dependencies injected into routes
- `scoring.py` - Assessment scoring (MCQ, heuristic text, domain aggregation)

### Frontend

- **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite** with React Router v7
- **Contexts**: `AuthContext` (Firebase user, session, memberships), `LanguageContext` (en/ko UI), `MembershipContext` (active org, role, classes)
- **UI**: Radix UI primitives + Tailwind CSS 4 + Framer Motion
- **Route-level lazy loading** via `React.lazy()` in `App.tsx`
- **Vendor chunking** configured in `vite.config.ts`

Frontend is organized into:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Router, lazy-loaded pages, `TeacherRoute` guard
- `frontend/src/api/` - Typed API client modules (teacher, assignments, schools, compliance)
- `frontend/src/types/` - TypeScript DTOs (school, assignment, curriculum)
- `frontend/src/pages/` - Page components
- `frontend/src/contexts/` - React contexts
- `frontend/src/components/` - Shared UI components

### Data Flow

1. Firebase Auth issues ID token → `/api/auth/verify` creates session + returns memberships
2. `MembershipContext` hydrates active org, role, classes
3. `TeacherRoute` guards teacher-only pages by checking membership role
4. Teacher creates assignment → assignment record stores instructions, generated scenario, and target fields directly
5. Student launches assignment → backend resolves assignment context → creates practice session
6. During practice: learning events emitted → session summary updated in real-time
7. Teacher views analytics: backend aggregates sessions + events into typed payloads

### Firestore Schema

```
users/{uid}/
  ├── profile/       (display_name, age, rigor, frequency, ui_language)
  ├── assessment/    (responses, current_item_index, completed)
  ├── results/       (global_stage, domain_bands, domain_raw_scores)
  └── chats/{id}/    (title, messages[], timestamps)

organizations/{orgId}          (name, type, status, pilot_stage, policies)
memberships/{membershipId}     (org_id, uid, roles[], status)
classes/{classId}              (org_id, name, term, subject, teacher_membership_ids[])
enrollments/{enrollmentId}     (class_id, student_uid, status, join_source)
assignments/{assignmentId}     (class_id, title, status, task_type, instructions, generated_scenario, target_expressions, focus_grammar)
practice_sessions/{sessionId}  (assignment_id, student_uid, session_summary, cost_summary)
learning_events/{eventId}      (assignment_id, session_id, event_type, turn_index, payload)
```

## Development Workflow Agents

This project has a local plugin (`lingual-dev-agents`) with 5 agents. Dispatch them at phase boundaries — they are not optional nice-to-haves, they are part of the workflow.

### Dispatch Rules

| Agent | When to dispatch | Skip when |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| `spec-agent` | Before implementing any TASKS.md item or feature that touches architecture, data model, or API surface | Pure UI polish, copy changes, or bug fixes confined to one file |
| `backend-impl` | During implementation, in parallel with `frontend-impl` when backend/frontend work is independent | Feature is frontend-only |
| `frontend-impl` | During implementation, in parallel with `backend-impl` when work is independent; sequentially after backend when frontend depends on new API | Feature is backend-only |
| `cross-layer-review` | After completing a feature that spans backend + frontend, especially if it touches compliance, prompt assembly, or analytics | Change is isolated to one layer with no cross-layer contract |
| `doc-sync` | After completing a TASKS.md phase or any change that introduces new collections, endpoints, or domain concepts | Trivial bug fixes that don't change architecture or shipped behavior |

### Parallel Dispatch Pattern

When a feature decomposes into independent backend + frontend work, dispatch `backend-impl` and `frontend-impl` simultaneously with `isolation: "worktree"`. Review both results, then run `cross-layer-review` on the merged state.

### Agent Output Rules

- `spec-agent`, `cross-layer-review`, and `doc-sync` are advisory — they propose, they don't modify files. Review their output before acting on it.
- `backend-impl` and `frontend-impl` write code in isolated worktrees. Review their changes before merging.
