"""Flag-gated Postgres read-cutover router (school-domain migration, read phase).

Wraps the Firestore `database` module on `deps.db`. Overrides ONLY the read
methods being cut over; every other attribute (writes, not-yet-cut readers,
module constants) passes through to Firestore via ``__getattr__`` — so routes
never change and the cutover is a localized, env-flag-driven flip.

Per-entity flags (``READ_PG_*``, read on every call, default OFF) gate each
entity FAMILY, 3-state:

  ``''`` / ``'0'``  -> Firestore only (today's behavior).
  ``'shadow'``      -> Firestore authoritative + the PG read compared for parity
                       (logged + counted, never surfaced). The safe pre-flip gate.
  ``'1'``           -> PG authoritative, FAIL-OPEN to Firestore on any error /
                       no engine / unresolved id.

Firestore stays the system of record until a flag flips to ``'1'``. Reuses the
dual-write engine resolver and the same short-lived, latency-bounded Session, so
a hung or broken Postgres can never break — nor unboundedly slow — a read (the
shadow compare runs synchronously before the Firestore result is returned).
