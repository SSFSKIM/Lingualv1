"""Flag-gated Postgres shadow-write for the ANALYTICS family.

Slice A: assignments (DUAL_WRITE_ASSIGNMENTS). Slice B: practice_sessions
(DUAL_WRITE_ANALYTICS_SESSIONS). Slice C: learning_events
(DUAL_WRITE_ANALYTICS_EVENTS) — `shadow_write_turn`, one batched transaction per
turn that subsumes the per-turn session UPDATE (§5b.2 #7 flag matrix).

Companion to `dual_write.py` (enrollments) and `dual_write_school_chain.py`
(org/membership/class): the SAME fail-open contract, gated on its OWN flag.
Assignments are the FK PARENT of practice_sessions and learning_events, so they
migrate first (ANALYTICS_MIGRATION.md Slice A); sessions resolve org+class+
assignment FKs and are the parent of events (Slice B/C).

Hot-path note: session writes ride the live voice/text practice path, so unlike
the low-churn assignment shadow they use `_run_with_timeout` (a parameterized
statement_timeout) NOT the shared `_run` (hardcoded 10s — a worst-case ceiling,
not a hot-path budget). See ANALYTICS_MIGRATION.md §2.3 / §5b.2.

Mirror strategy (assignments are LOW-CHURN curriculum docs, not a hot path):
  - CREATE / EDIT reuse the idempotent `backfill.upsert_assignment`. The Firestore
    write is a full `doc_ref.set()` (create, or overwrite when an id is supplied),
    so one idempotent upsert faithfully mirrors both. upsert_assignment resolves
    org_id + class_id -> UUIDs and raises UnresolvedParentError (a quiet
    coexistence no-op, swallowed by `_run`) when a parent is not in Postgres yet.
  - The Canvas link/unlink path touches one PG column (canvas_module_item_id) via a
    TARGETED UPDATE keyed by legacy_firestore_id — never an upsert, which would
    clobber the NOT-NULL content fields with a partial doc.

NOT mirrored: `set_assignment_grade_config` writes grade_metric/grade_points, which
are Firestore-only LTI fields with NO column on the PG Assignment model — out of
scope for this slice (see ANALYTICS_MIGRATION.md §1).

Heavy imports stay lazy inside function bodies; flag-OFF cost is os + logging.

    (ANALYTICS_MIGRATION.md §2.3 forbids reusing it; §5b.2 #1). `timeout_ms` is
    keyword-only so a caller can't pass it positionally where `_run` takes none.

    Same fail-open contract as `_run`: `UnresolvedParentError` is the expected
    coexistence no-op (parent not yet backfilled) logged at debug; any other

    Session(engine)` returns the connection to the pool on every exit path.

    LATENCY MODEL (codex P1 — do NOT mistake `timeout_ms` for a request-latency cap):
    `timeout_ms` bounds the STATEMENT only. The first `execute()` is also where
    SQLAlchemy checks out (or opens) a connection, which happens BEFORE Postgres can
    apply statement_timeout. Healthy PG: ~tens of ms. Degraded PG: a contended checkout
    waits up to `sql.py` pool_timeout (3s) and a cold connect up to its connect timeout
    (~10s) before fail-open catches it. Callers MUST already have written Firestore (the
    system of record) first, so this is a response-latency tail under a PG incident, not
    data loss. Moving the shadow off the hot path is the GA upgrade (§5b.3); at one-school
    beta this tail is accepted — it is the same exposure the live PG read paths carry.
