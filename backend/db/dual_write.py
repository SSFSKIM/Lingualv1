"""Flag-gated Postgres shadow-write for enrollments (school-domain migration, slice 2b).

Firestore stays the system of record; Postgres is a SHADOW that must NEVER break
or slow the live write. Every public `shadow_*` function is FAIL-OPEN:

  - gated on DUAL_WRITE_ENROLLMENTS=1 AND a configured engine (else a pure no-op),
  - opens and closes its own short-lived Session (the live request owns no session),
  - bounds its own latency (pool_timeout + connect timeout in sql.py; a transaction-
    scoped statement_timeout here) so a hung Postgres cannot inflate the request,
  - wraps the whole shadow op in try/except and NEVER raises into the caller.

Heavy imports (SQLAlchemy, repository, models) are LAZY — inside function bodies —
so when the flag is OFF the import footprint is just this module plus os/logging.

Strategy A (trust-backfill): only enrollments are mirrored here; orgs, memberships,
and classes are populated by the 2a backfill. At write time the only resolution is
class_id (Firestore string) -> Postgres UUID. An unresolved parent is the EXPECTED
coexistence case (class enrolled-against was created before its backfill) and is a
quiet no-op, reconciled later by parity_report + re-running the backfill.

Nothing here reads request state; callers pass `sql_engine` (the deps.sql_engine
zero-arg provider, which returns the engine or None).
