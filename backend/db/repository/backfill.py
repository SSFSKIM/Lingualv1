"""Enrollment-chain backfill (slice 2a): Firestore docs -> Postgres rows.

Scope is strictly the tenancy/roster chain — organizations, memberships,
classes, enrollments — per docs/school-integration/POSTGRES_SCHEMA.md
("Backfill Normalization And ID Resolution"). Assignments, compliance, Canvas,
LTI, practice, and learning events are out of scope and untouched here.

This is OFFLINE backfill tooling. Nothing here is wired into a live route or
`deps.db`; the caller owns the engine, the Session, and the
commit/rollback decision.

Design:
- Each `upsert_*` is idempotent by `legacy_firestore_id` (the Firestore doc id):
  it SELECTs the existing row first and UPDATEs in place, else INSERTs. After
  add/update it calls `session.flush()` so the row's UUID `id` is available for
  children to resolve via `resolution.resolve_legacy_id`.
- Foreign references are Firestore string ids; they resolve to Postgres UUIDs
  through each parent's unique `legacy_firestore_id` index. A missing parent is
  a hard error (the run must process PARENT-FIRST so the parent already exists).
- `run_backfill` processes organizations -> memberships -> classes ->
  enrollments. In `dry_run` mode it performs NO writes/flushes: it runs the pure
  transforms + a resolution dry pass, counts would-be inserts/updates, and
  reports unresolved parents. The caller must roll back after a dry run.

Value remaps and field coercions are delegated to the pure transforms in
`normalization.py` (already written) — this module does not reimplement them.
