"""Enrollment-chain backfill (slice 2a): Firestore docs -> Postgres rows.

Scope is strictly the tenancy/roster chain — organizations, memberships,
classes, enrollments — per docs/school-integration/POSTGRES_SCHEMA.md
("Backfill Normalization And ID Resolution"). Assignments, compliance, Canvas,
LTI, practice, and learning events are out of scope and untouched here.

This is OFFLINE backfill tooling. Nothing here is wired into a live route or
`deps.db`; the caller owns the engine, the Session, and the
commit/rollback decision.

Design:
- Each `upsert_*` is idempotent by `legacy_firestore_id` (the Firestore doc id):
  it SELECTs the existing row first and UPDATEs in place, else INSERTs. After
  add/update it calls `session.flush()` so the row's UUID `id` is available for
  children to resolve via `resolution.resolve_legacy_id`.
- Foreign references are Firestore string ids; they resolve to Postgres UUIDs
  through each parent's unique `legacy_firestore_id` index. A missing parent is
  a hard error (the run must process PARENT-FIRST so the parent already exists).
- `run_backfill` processes organizations -> memberships -> classes ->
  enrollments. In `dry_run` mode it performs NO writes/flushes: it runs the pure
  transforms + a resolution dry pass, counts would-be inserts/updates, and
  reports unresolved parents. The caller must roll back after a dry run.

Value remaps and field coercions are delegated to the pure transforms in
`normalization.py` (already written) — this module does not reimplement them.

    Processes organizations -> memberships -> classes -> enrollments. Each
    entity's docs are an iterable of Firestore-shaped dicts (each carrying its
    doc 'id' as the legacy_firestore_id source).

    Returns per-entity stats: {entity: {inserted, updated, skipped, errors, warnings}}.
    Each row's upsert runs inside a SAVEPOINT (session.begin_nested), so a row
    that fails at flush (NOT NULL, CHECK, unique) rolls back ONLY that row and is
    reported under `errors` — it never poisons the outer transaction or aborts the
    later docs/entities. A doc missing its Firestore `id` is rejected as an error
    (a NULL legacy_firestore_id can't be deduplicated). `warnings` records
    non-fatal data downgrades (e.g. an enrollment whose student_membership_id did
    not resolve and was left NULL).

    PRECONDITION: the caller MUST have run the pre-backfill uniqueness scans
    (POSTGRES_SCHEMA.md "Pre-backfill uniqueness scans") and aborted on violation.
    Two membership docs normalizing to the same active (org_id, firebase_uid)
    would each fail the partial-unique index; the SAVEPOINT keeps that to one
    per-row error instead of an aborted run, but it does not substitute for the
    scan.

    dry_run=True performs NO writes or flushes. It runs the pure transforms and a
    resolution DRY PASS (SELECT-only) to classify each doc as a would-be insert
    vs. update, surface unresolved required parents (errors), and flag would-be
    NULL-FK downgrades (warnings). The CALLER must roll back after a dry run; this
    function never commits.
