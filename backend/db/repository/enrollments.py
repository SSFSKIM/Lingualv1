"""Enrollment repository — the first Postgres twin (INERT in this increment).

Enrollments are the lowest-blast-radius first cutover candidate: the
deterministic Firestore composite key `{class_id}_{student_uid}` maps to a
Postgres unique key, the student reference is a Firebase UID (stable across
both stores, no resolution needed), and the row has no ref-leak or sentinel
coupling.

These functions take Postgres-native INPUTS — `class_id` is the resolved
Postgres UUID, `student_uid` is the Firebase UID (the router resolves the
Firestore string `class_id` -> UUID via `resolution.resolve_legacy_id` before
calling, and owns the Session lifecycle). But the serialized OUTPUT is
Firestore-shaped: foreign keys (`class_id`, `student_membership_id`) are
emitted as the PARENT's `legacy_firestore_id` (its Firestore doc id), resolved
by JOIN in the read queries — NOT the Postgres UUID. This is the read-side
serializer invariant (READ_CUTOVER.md §3.0): a caller that does
`get_class(enrollment['class_id'])` must receive a Firestore class id, or the
lookup silently misses. Emitting `str(row.class_id)` (the UUID) was the
original twin's bug (defect D1).

Nothing here is wired into a route yet.
