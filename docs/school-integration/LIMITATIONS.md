# School Integration Limitations

## Purpose

This document tracks currently known implementation limitations, temporary constraints, and intentional shortcuts in the school-integration build.

Use it when:

- a shipped implementation is narrower than the target architecture in `TECH_SPEC.md`
- a route, model, or UI exists but is still sample-only or placeholder-backed
- a later phase depends on hardening or replacing the current behavior

This is not the product source of truth. Product and architecture decisions still live in:

- `PRD.md`
- `TECH_SPEC.md`
- `TASKS.md`

## Current limitations

### School foundation

1. Teacher onboarding currently bootstraps one organization, one teacher-admin membership, and one first class in a single flow.
Impact: fast for pilot setup, but not yet suitable for real multi-teacher org administration.
Planned follow-up: org settings, invite flows, and role management.

2. Student invite/join flow supports class join codes and Canvas LMS roster sync, but advanced roster workflows are not yet complete.
Impact: teachers can generate/regenerate/deactivate join codes, students can join via `/app/join`, and teachers can view the roster and remove students. Canvas LMS roster sync is now available — matched students get active enrollments, unmatched students get `pending_sync` enrollments that auto-activate on login. However, CSV import, bulk invite, and email-based invitations are not yet implemented.
Planned follow-up: CSV roster import, email-based invitations, and Google Classroom integration.

3. Teacher analytics are available at class, assignment, and student level with basic filtering, but are still heuristic-based.
Impact: teachers can now navigate from the dashboard to class analytics (aggregated across assignments), student drill-down (per-student across assignments), and per-assignment analytics. The dashboard now supports a class filter that recalculates summary stats for a single class, and the class analytics page supports date range filtering (server-side session filtering) and assignment status filtering (client-side). However, all metrics (speaking time, rubric scores, error detection) are still heuristic estimates from transcript-level signals, not model-verified or provider-accurate. The dashboard-level speaking minutes stat now aggregates estimated speaking time from practice sessions across the teacher's classes.
Planned follow-up: cross-class trends, richer visualization, and model-backed scoring calibration.

### Curriculum mapping and assignments

4. Imported curriculum packages are not part of the shipped beta path.
Impact: the legacy bundled sample package and `curriculum_mappings` path have been removed. Teachers now author assignments from Canvas content, teacher-provided source packets, or manual advanced authoring. There is no package browser or imported-package workflow in the beta UI.
Planned follow-up: revisit imported curriculum packages only if pilot schools need a non-Canvas managed content library.

5. Assignment launch now supports assignment-scoped text fallback, but the text experience still lives in the assignment launch page instead of the shared chat shell.
Impact: `text_only` or downgraded launches now work and remain assignment-aware, but text transcripts and follow-up review still do not reuse the main chat workspace UX or a richer text-specific teacher review surface.
Planned follow-up: unify assignment text practice with the shared chat shell and extend text-mode review affordances.

6. Live prompt generation is assignment-driven, but it is still a pre-session prompt layer rather than a live intervention engine.
Impact: `instructions`, `generatedScenario`, `objectives`, `targetExpressions`, `focusGrammar`, teacher notes, task type, success criteria, and compliance/modality metadata now shape the tutor prompt directly from the assignment document. This removes the old sample-curriculum and pedagogy-package path, but there is still no mid-session server-side intervention layer once a realtime session starts.
Planned follow-up: stricter prompt-policy enforcement, stronger source-to-assignment traceability, and a later event-driven intervention layer if beta evidence shows it is needed.

7. Practice analytics are improved, but still not equivalent to human scoring.
Impact: assignment launch now creates `practice_sessions`, emits lifecycle and turn-level `learning_events`, and rolls them into per-session summaries plus a teacher-facing assignment analytics page. The runtime now also tracks repeated-error patterns, feedback-linked correction families, actual context-tag signals, rubric-dimension evidence, rubric thresholds/confidence, and locale-aware communicative-function / discourse-move / feedback detection for English and French. However, these detections and rubric scores are still rule-based heuristics rather than model-verified semantics or certified assessment scoring.
Planned follow-up: richer realtime instrumentation, rubric-scoring calibration against teacher review, repeated-error families beyond the current rule catalog, and stronger semantic analysis.

8. Speaking time and cost are currently estimated, not provider-accurate.
Impact: session summaries derive speaking time from transcript word counts and track estimated voice seconds / text turns, but they do not yet use raw audio durations or provider billing metadata for precise cost accounting.
Planned follow-up: realtime usage metering, model-cost accounting, and budget enforcement.

### Compliance and policy

9. Compliance gating, guardian packets, deletion requests, and school-wide admin tooling are now implemented for the beta scope.
Impact: voice now fails closed without consent, `textFallbackEnabled` controls assignment downgrade behavior, pronunciation raw-audio retention is policy-aware, teachers/admins can edit consent state from student drill-down, class-scoped compliance roster/bulk operations/audit export are available, guardian packets can now be issued/resend/canceled from student drill-down with a secure-link public decision flow, school admins can create/approve/execute/retry deletion requests for student, class, or org scope, and school admins now have an org-wide compliance dashboard with summary metrics, filterable cross-class student roster with bulk consent operations, guardian packet tracking, and org-scoped audit CSV export. However, `downloadable_notice` remains a staff-managed beta path without a rendered handout artifact, deletion execution is synchronous (not async Cloud Tasks), and Firebase Storage audio deletion is a placeholder (no raw audio stored yet).
Planned follow-up: async deletion execution if needed post-beta, Firebase Storage cleanup when raw audio storage ships, and richer guardian evidence/export tooling.

10. Firestore rules are now school-aware and validated via Firebase Emulator rule tests (`firebase-tests/`). Deployment rehearsal is still pending before pilot hardening is complete.
Impact: rule logic is validated against emulator tests covering all school collections and role-based access patterns.
Planned follow-up: deployment verification during hardening.

### Canvas LMS integration

12. Canvas LMS integration is implemented for beta scope with the following constraints:
Impact: PAT-based auth (one connection per class), manual re-sync only (no webhooks), email-first identity matching with pending_sync for unmatched students. Canvas connections store encrypted PATs server-side (AES-256-GCM). Students see synced course content via `canvas_course_content` collection on AppLearningPage with "Start Practice" for linked items. Teachers can link/unlink assignments to Canvas items in the assignment builder. Firebase emulator rule tests require Java runtime which may not be available in all environments.
Planned follow-up: OAuth2 flow for Canvas auth, automatic webhook-based sync, SIS ID fallback matching, and sync cooldown enforcement.

11. Disclosure logging covers two endpoints (teacher student analytics drill-down, admin compliance roster) but not all sensitive read paths.
Impact: the admin roster view logs a single org-scoped event (`student_uid=''`) rather than per-student events to avoid N+1 writes. Other endpoints that surface student data (e.g., class analytics, student drill-down compliance tab, guardian packet views) do not yet emit disclosure events.
Planned follow-up: extend disclosure logging to remaining sensitive endpoints as the audit requirements are clarified with counsel.

### Teacher debrief of student practice sessions

13. Teachers cannot yet view the actual content of student practice sessions — only aggregate statistics.
Impact: the class analytics, student drill-down, and assignment analytics pages all return aggregated `session_summary` counts (turn counts, speaking time, self-corrections, feedback counts, rubric scores) but there is **no teacher endpoint** to read the conversation transcript itself. Practice sessions store a `chatId` reference to the chat transcript, but `backend/routes/chat.py` is student-only (`deps.get_current_user_uid()` scoped). A teacher who wants to see what their student actually said to the AI tutor has no way to do so from the dashboard.
Planned follow-up: (a) add `GET /api/teacher/classes/<class_id>/students/<student_uid>/sessions/<session_id>/transcript` endpoint that verifies teacher class access and returns chat messages; (b) add transcript viewing UI to `TeacherStudentDrillDownPage`; (c) add AI-generated narrative summary service (`backend/services/session_summary_generator.py`) that calls GPT-4 on the learning events to produce a teacher-readable debrief; (d) show summary alongside the heuristic `session_summary` aggregates.

15. Student dashboard class list uses N+1 Firestore reads.
Impact: `database.list_student_classes` (called by `GET /api/student/classes`) iterates student enrollments and fetches each class document in a loop. For a student in N classes that is 1 (`list_student_enrollments`) + N (`get_class`) Firestore reads per dashboard load. This is fine for the pilot (students are typically in ≤3 classes), but it scales linearly with enrollments.
Planned follow-up: batch class lookups via `get_all` / `in` queries once students routinely exceed ~5 enrollments.

14. Voice conversation recording and audio playback are not yet implemented or tested end-to-end.
Impact: the OpenAI Realtime API streams audio chunks during voice conversations but the current pipeline only captures transcribed text from `student.turn` events — raw audio bytes are never persisted. There is no `audio_url` or recording reference on practice sessions, and no Firebase Storage bucket wired up for speech recordings. End-to-end voice testing (teacher assigns voice assignment → student speaks → teacher plays back the recording) has not been executed because the recording infrastructure does not exist yet. Testing to date has only covered chat-mode (text-only) assignments.
Planned follow-up: (a) decide recording architecture (client-side MediaRecorder + Firebase Storage upload vs. server-side stream capture vs. third-party transcription archive); (b) add `audio_url` / `recording_ref` field to practice sessions; (c) wire consent-aware retention policy (already modeled in `student_compliance_records.retention_policy_id` — `no_raw_audio` vs. `standard_school`); (d) add audio player UI to teacher transcript view; (e) run full voice-mode E2E test (teacher assigns voice → student speaks → teacher plays recording + views transcript + reads AI debrief).

### Curriculum content authored only for French; other locales get French scenarios in translation

16. Resolved 2026-04-18 via Commit C of the Canvas content migration.
Impact: the French-only sample curriculum path is gone. Assignment content now comes from Canvas material or teacher-authored input, so non-French classes are no longer forced through translated AP French scenarios just to launch practice.
Resolution: Phase 2+3 Canvas migration removed `curriculum_mappings`, deleted the sample curriculum package loader, stored scenario fields directly on `assignments`, and removed the legacy curriculum override from realtime session creation.

### Pilot shortcut: teacher invitations auto-approve

17. Teacher invitations are auto-approved during the pilot — the `school_admin` review step is bypassed.
Impact: any teacher who enters a valid `teacher_invite_code` in `POST /api/schools/join-as-teacher` is immediately granted a `teacher` membership without `school_admin` approval. The `teacher_invitations` document is still created for audit trail (marked `status: "approved"` with `reviewed_by_uid: "system:pilot_auto_approve"`), and the `/api/schools/teacher-invitations/<id>/approve` admin endpoint still exists but now returns `409 "Invitation is already approved."` when called against an auto-approved invite. This was introduced to unblock the SSFS Pilot launch where no `school_admin` was available at the time teachers joined.
Planned follow-up: (a) restore the manual-approval flow by reverting the `api_join_as_teacher` change in `backend/routes/schools.py` once the pilot is over, or (b) gate the auto-approval behind a per-org `auto_approve_teacher_joins` boolean on the organization document for long-term use in trust-first deployments (e.g., self-serve school signups where the same person is both admin and teacher).
