# School Integration Tasks

Status: Active
Last updated: 2026-04-18
Owner: Engineering + Product

## Status legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[-]` in progress
- `[x]` done
- `[!]` blocked / needs decision

## Phase 0: Documentation and architecture lock

- [x] Create formal `docs/` structure for the school track.
- [x] Draft `PRD.md`.
- [x] Draft `TECH_SPEC.md`.
- [x] Draft `TASKS.md`.
- [x] Create `LIMITATIONS.md` for ongoing implementation constraints tracking.
- [ ] Review docs with product lead and confirm beta scope.
- [ ] Convert open questions into explicit architecture decisions.

## Phase 1: School foundation

### Auth and roles

- [x] Extend `/api/auth/verify` to return memberships and active org context.
- [x] Add backend request-context helper for active membership and role scope.
- [x] Add frontend `MembershipContext`.
- [x] Add role-aware route guards for teacher vs student pages.
- [x] Update `User` and related frontend types to include membership context.

### Domain model

- [x] Add Firestore collections for `organizations`, `memberships`, `classes`, and `enrollments`.
- [x] Define indexes needed for teacher class queries and student enrollment lookups.
- [x] Add secure Firestore rules for org/class-scoped reads and writes.
- [ ] Define data migration plan for existing users who only have `profile.school_name`.

### UI shell

- [x] Replace unrestricted `/app/teacher` access with teacher-only routing.
- [x] Build teacher home page data contract.
- [x] Add class list page or section for teachers with multiple classes.

## Phase 2: School onboarding and roster workflows

### Admin school registration wizard

- [x] Admin org wizard — 4-step form with autosave draft
- [x] Authorization attestation with server-stamped IP hash + UA
- [x] Pre-invite teachers list on submit; auto-invitations on approval
- [x] Approval / decline transactional emails via outbox

### Teacher onboarding

- [x] Design separate school onboarding flow from learner onboarding.
- [x] Create class manually flow.
- [x] Invite student flow (class join code + student join page + roster management).
- [x] Add basic teacher-facing setup checklist state.
- [x] Hybrid teacher join: invite code + name search (Plan 4)
- [x] Admin approval pipeline with email notification (Plan 4)
- [x] Removed auto-approve from /api/schools/join-as-teacher (Plan 4)
- [x] organizations.school_admin_uids denormalization for rules (Plan 4)
- [x] PendingTeacherRequestsSection on TeacherDashboardPage (Plan 4)
- [ ] Backfill `organizations.school_admin_uids` for orgs created before Plan 4 — run `scripts/backfill_school_admin_uids.py`
- [ ] Backfill `organizations.name_lower` for orgs created before Plan 4 — run `scripts/backfill_org_name_lower.py`
- [x] **(Plan 5 acceptance)** Any membership-removal path MUST call `_sync_org_admin_uids(org_id, uid, add=False)` when removing `school_admin`. Extended `backend/tests/test_school_admin_uids_invariant.py` with the removal regression (Plan 5 Task 7).
- [ ] Replace in-memory org search rate limiter with a shared store (Redis / Firestore counter) when scaling to multi-replica.
- [ ] 7-day reminder email for stale pending teacher join requests (v1.5). **Product decision needed before launch.**
- [ ] Realtime status listener on `/signup/teacher/pending` (replace 30s polling, v1.5).
- [ ] Wrap teacher-join approve flow in a Firestore batch/transaction (v1.5). Introduces the project's first transactional path — plan it cross-cuttingly.
- [ ] Document `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `.env.example` and the deployment runbook.
- [ ] Top-level `try/except` wrapper around the main body of each route in `backend/routes/teacher_requests.py` (matches `school_requests.py` pattern; ensures Firestore transient errors return shaped JSON, not unformatted HTML 500).

### LMS / roster import

- [x] Decide first LMS integration order — Canvas LMS first.
- [x] Choose first-party priority between Google Classroom and Canvas — Canvas chosen.
- [x] Implement LMS connection record model (`canvas_connections`, `canvas_course_content` collections).
- [x] Implement Canvas API client with pagination and typed errors (`backend/services/canvas/client.py`).
- [x] Implement PAT encryption with AES-256-GCM (`backend/services/canvas/encryption.py`).
- [x] Implement roster sync service with email match and pending_sync flow (`backend/services/canvas/sync.py`). *Superseded 2026-04-21: see roster-decouple entry below.*
- [x] Implement Canvas integration routes: validate, connect, sync, status, disconnect, link/unlink (`backend/routes/integrations.py`).
- [x] Activate pending Canvas enrollments on student login (`backend/routes/auth.py`). *Removed 2026-04-21: see roster-decouple entry below.*
- [x] Add Firestore rules for Canvas collections (deny-all for connections, enrolled-student read for content).
- [x] Build teacher Canvas connect flow (two-step: validate PAT + select course) (`CanvasConnectPage.tsx`).
- [x] Build Canvas sync status component for class analytics page (`CanvasSyncStatus.tsx`).
- [x] Build Canvas assignment link picker (`CanvasLinkPicker.tsx`).
- [x] Build student Canvas module view component (`CanvasModuleView.tsx`).
- [x] Add Canvas link button to teacher dashboard class cards.
- [x] Decouple Canvas roster from Lingual enrollments (2026-04-21).
  See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-21-canvas-roster-decouple-from-enrollment-design.md`
  and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-21-canvas-roster-decouple-from-enrollment.md`.
  Ships: new `canvas_roster_entries/` collection, "On Canvas roster" badge
  and "not yet joined" gap view on the teacher roster, `GET /api/teacher/classes/<class_id>/canvas-roster-gap`
  endpoint, one-time migration script at `scripts/migrate_canvas_roster_decouple.py`,
  removal of `pending_sync`-on-login activation in `auth.py`, and removal
  of email-match auto-enroll from `reconcile_enrollments`. Canvas PAT sync
  no longer writes to `enrollments/`; enrollments come only from join
  code or LTI deep-link launch. Deferred: manual "link to Canvas roster
  entry" UI for the email-mismatch case (see `LIMITATIONS.md` item 20).
- [ ] Add manual CSV fallback if LMS setup is delayed.

### Lingual admin panel (Plan 5)

- [x] Routes mounted at `/lingual-admin/*` (top-level, outside `/app`, so AppLayout does not double-nest with `LingualAdminShell`).
- [x] `lingual_admin_audit` collection with `AuditLogger` service.
- [x] 12 endpoints under `backend/routes/lingual_admin.py`.
- [x] Org suspend/restore with email fan-out via outbox.
- [x] Auto-restore hourly Cloud Function scheduler.
- [x] Suspended-org enforcement at 5 points (assignment_resolver, realtime mint, practice mutations, canvas_practice, teacher writes).
- [x] Member removal UI with `_sync_org_admin_uids(add=False)` invariant test (Plan 4 forward obligation).
- [x] `org_suspended` + `org_restored` email templates.
- [x] `/app/admin` school_admin home route (separated from `/app/teacher`).
- [x] AuthContext 5-min `/api/auth/verify` polling.
- [x] Legacy `/api/admin/school-requests/*` endpoints return 410 Gone.
- [x] Legacy `/app/admin/school-requests` route redirects to `/lingual-admin/requests`.

- [ ] `PATCH /api/lingual-admin/organizations/<orgId>` (org metadata editing) — v1.5.
- [ ] Realtime listener for org-detail audit feed (replace pagination, v1.5).
- [ ] Bulk export of org audit feed as CSV — v1.5.
- [ ] Internationalize Lingual admin panel UI (en-only in v1).
- [ ] Wire `school_request_reminder_to_lingual` once the outbox sweep gap (LIMITATIONS #21) is closed.
- [ ] Delete orphan Firestore composite index `enrollments(status, student_uid, updated_at DESC)` (LIMITATIONS #41) — safe, redundant with the IaC-managed `(student_uid, status, updated_at DESC)` index. Targeted `gcloud firestore indexes composite delete` command in LIMITATIONS #41.
- [ ] Reminder email for inactive suspended orgs (≥30 days suspended_until in past with auto-restore disabled) — needs product decision before launch.
- [ ] Backfill top-level `country` from `location.country` for `school_requests` rows submitted before the LIMITATIONS #47 denormalization fix. One-shot script: query `school_requests` where `country` is missing AND `location.country` is non-empty; write `country` to each. Until run, the Requests page country filter (LIMITATIONS #47) matches only post-fix rows.
- [ ] Backfill org metadata (`school_type`, `country`, `state`, `website_url`, `public_or_private`, `grade_size`) on `organizations/` rows created before the LIMITATIONS #49 approval-time copy fix. One-shot script: for each org, look up the originating `school_requests` doc via `created_org_id` reverse lookup; copy missing fields. Until run, those pre-fix orgs render blanks in the Plan 5 detail page and are excluded from filtered org-list queries.
- [ ] Wire `make test-emulator` into CI so a missing composite index trips before deploy. Infrastructure exists (`backend/tests/test_firestore_indexes.py` + Makefile target) but Plan 5 round-4 surfaced a class of index-shaped findings (LIMITATIONS #50) that FakeDb-only test suites cannot catch. Requires Java runtime on CI agents + Firebase CLI; add as a separate job that runs alongside `make test-backend`.
- [ ] Share the school-type enum between FE and BE (LIMITATIONS #51 root cause). Today both sides hand-code overlapping lists in TS and Python, and the round-4 drift (`elementary` in TS, not in BE's `ALLOWED_SCHOOL_TYPES`) was caught by Codex review rather than the type system. Either (a) emit the Python enum as a generated TS const at build time, or (b) move both to a single JSON/YAML source-of-truth that both layers read.

## Phase 3: Canvas content and assignment authoring

- [x] Enforce assignment-aware prompt assembly for school practice.

### Assignment prompt policy

- [x] Encode assignment-aware prompt assembly around instructions, generated scenario, and teacher targets.

- [x] Add dashboard filters for date range, class, and assignment.

## Phase 6: Compliance, privacy, and retention

### Compliance model

- [x] Add `student_compliance_records` model.
- [x] Add `consent_events` audit trail.
- [x] Define retention policy objects and defaults.
- [ ] Define deletion request and deletion execution flow.
- [x] Define guardian-facing consent workflow, evidence model, and delivery path.
- [x] Add teacher and school-admin consent review/update workflow within authorized school scope.
