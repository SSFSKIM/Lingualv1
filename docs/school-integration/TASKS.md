## Phase 6: Compliance, privacy, and retention

### Compliance model

- [x] Add `consent_events` audit trail.
- [x] Define retention policy objects and defaults.
- [ ] Define deletion request and deletion execution flow.
- [x] Define guardian-facing consent workflow, evidence model, and delivery path.

Current completion state:

1. Class-scoped compliance roster, bulk consent operations, and audit export are shipped.
2. Epic A guardian consent packets are shipped with secure-link guardian response, teacher/admin packet management, and packet status surfaces in class compliance plus student drill-down.
3. `downloadable_notice` remains a staff-managed beta path; it records packet state without generating a rendered handout artifact.
4. The remaining hardening work is now centered on Epic B deletion requests/execution, followed by school-wide admin tooling.

### Epic A: Guardian Consent Packets

- [x] Freeze packet states, notice versioning, token TTL, and delivery methods.
- [x] Add `guardian_consent_packets` model and packet audit taxonomy.
- [x] Add teacher/admin packet issuance, resend, and cancel endpoints.
- [x] Add guardian decision endpoint for secure-link delivery.
- [x] Add packet status surface to class compliance and student drill-down flows.
- [x] Add reminder and expiry handling.

### Epic B: Deletion Requests and Execution

- [ ] Freeze request scope rules and approval matrix.
- [ ] Add `deletion_requests` model.
- [ ] Add `deletion_execution_runs` model.
- [ ] Add request create/review/detail endpoints for admin workflows.
- [ ] Add async execution worker for Firestore and Storage cleanup.
- [ ] Add execution summary, retry handling, and partial-failure recovery rules.

Recommended sequence for the remaining hardening work:

1. Epic B: Deletion requests and execution.
2. School-wide admin tooling on top of the current compliance stack.

### Policy review

- [ ] Validate COPPA workflow assumptions with counsel.
- [ ] Validate FERPA vendor / school-official workflow assumptions with counsel.
- [ ] Validate state biometric-risk assumptions, including Illinois BIPA exposure, with counsel.

## Phase 7: Pilot readiness

- [ ] Recruit 5-10 co-design teachers.
- [ ] Create pilot feedback loop and weekly issue triage.
- [ ] Prepare teacher onboarding guide.
- [ ] Prepare compliance and data-handling one-pager for pilot schools.
- [ ] Define beta support process for consent, roster, and integration issues.

## Recommended build order

1. Auth, memberships, and teacher route protection.
2. Class model and onboarding split.
3. Curriculum mappings and assignments.
4. Assignment-aware session bootstrap and prompt resolver.
5. Learning events and dashboard APIs.
6. Compliance enforcement and LMS hardening.

## Immediate next sprint
